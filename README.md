# Weather-Forecasting-System-SW-Project
Weather Forecast Platform, which allows people to get know the weather forecast based on their location or other locations

➢ The Aim of the Project:

To make a real time weather application that takes user’s exact location and provides weather forecast for the day and upcoming days.

We also tried to design a simple but  visual  UI  that  provides  comprehensive  data.  

Also,  the  application  provides suggestions  to  users  based  on  weather  conditions.

And  lastly,  user  can  search  and access data for custom locations (string based).
